Swagger is primarily designed for API documentation and testing, particularly RESTful APIs. It helps define endpoints, request/response formats, and provides a UI for testing those endpoints. 

For testing JavaScript functions or methods, you'd typically use tools like:

1. **Jest**: A popular testing framework for JavaScript, especially for React applications.
2. **Mocha**: A flexible testing framework that can be used with various assertion libraries.
3. **Chai**: An assertion library that can be used with Mocha or other testing frameworks.
4. **Jasmine**: A behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript.

These tools allow you to write unit tests for your functions, ensuring they work as expected. If you're looking to document and test functions in a more API-like manner, you might consider using something like **Postman** or **OpenAPI** for APIs, but for direct JavaScript function testing, the aforementioned frameworks are more suitable.
